#Faith Based Affordable Housing 

This project is based on the research of Dr. Nadia Mian at the Voorhees Center for Civic Engagement on "YIGBY" developments. YIBGY refers to "Yes in God's Backyard" in which faith-based
insitutions such as churches, synagouges, mosques, etc that had redeveloped a part of their sites to be turned into affordable housing units. The following map intreprets data that 
has been collected through scraping data about the developments created from 2015-2025, as well as data from the US Census and current YIBGY legislature. 

This webmap will include two static maps and two dynamic maps to held visualize the current state of faith-based Affordable Housing in the United States.

This map represents the percentage of each state in which there is ‘rent burden’ this means renter spend 30% or more of the household income on their rent. The map represents the percentage of people who are rent burdened in each state. This was created using the ACS 2016-2020 Estimates from the US Census. Overlayed is the faith-based development points. The intention with this static map is to showcase the relationship between affordable housing development and rent burdened populations.

This dynamic map showcases the developments that are specific to New York City. It is overlayed with a heat map representing the residential evictions that have happened within the past two year (2023-2025), in addition to this, one can see the parts of NYC that are zoned as “inclusionary Housing Areas.” This means that developers building in those areas get a tax credit for including affordable housing units in their buildings. The data was pulled from the NYC open data portal.
